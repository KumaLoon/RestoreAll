Back up and restore things from your jailbroken device

I will be putting files that are being tested.

# Release Note
This is still in beta.
- Issues:
	- Restoring photo would not clear cache	(You need to manually clear cache of Photos after restoring photos in order to fix it(Create a Album in Photos App.))
	- Restoring Library is disabled.
	- This doesn’t back up Music perfectly, all the music are present but may have some musics that are missing informations.
	- This DOES back up and restore Cydia repos, but doesn’t add the sources to the Cydia 1.1.10 or above. Which means it does download everything from those repos but not listed in the 	Cydia.
- Note:
	- File verification system is not available in this version
	- Offline mode will be available later. (hopefully)
	- If SSH verification shows warning, check “~/.ssh/known_hosts”
	- Storage Warning will be available soon. (Again, hopefully)
	- Build-In update system will be available soon.

# Important Note
This program will NOT save nor show your password to anyone including you.

You should NEVER trust any other versions of RestoreAll from any unknown sites (Like sites that are not verified by LooneySJ.) If you paid for this software, demand for a refund.

Beta Version cannot guarantee a successful result, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
