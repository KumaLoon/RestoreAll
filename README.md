# Release Note
This is still in beta.
- Issues:
	- Restoring photo would not clear cache	(You need to clear cache of Photos after restoring 	photos in order to fix it(Create a Album in Photos App.))
	- Restoring Library is disabled in this version
	- Because iTunes’ encode musics, this tool doesn’t back up Music perfectly, all the music are 	present but may have some musics that are missing names.
- Note:
	- File verification system is not available in this version
	- Offline mode will be available later. (hopefully)
	- If SSH verification shows warning, check “~/.ssh/known_hosts”
	- Storage Warning will be available soon. (Again, hopefully)
	- Build-In update system will be available soon.
	- This DOES back up and restore Cydia repos, but doesn’t add the sources to the Cydia 1.1.10 or above. Which means it does download everything from those repos but not listed in the Cydia.

# Important Note
This program will NOT save nor show your password to anyone including you.

You should NEVER trust any other versions of RestoreAll from any unknown sites (Like sites that are not verified by LooneySJ.) If you paid for this software, demand for a refund.

Beta Version cannot guarantee a successful result, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
