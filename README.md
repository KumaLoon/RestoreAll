# Release Note
This is still in beta.
- Issues:
    - Restoring Library is partially enabled in this version, you can use the feature but most of them are broken. If you did an update to your device, please don’t restore library because it may break your device.
    - During the wireless file transfer, SCP halts when screen is locked. (Workaround: Turn off auto-lock or plug your device to charger.)
    - "Back up Library" feature may break your devices. (especially users on iOS 8)
    - Restoring Photos may prevent you from taking photos.
    - Back up/Restore SMS feature is broken.
- Notes:
    - Because iTunes’ encoded musics and videos, this tool doesn’t back up things perfectly, all the 	things are present but may have some things that are missing names.
    - After restoring SMS and Photos, you have to do a manual reboot (shut down and boot)
    - iOS 9 is partically supported.
	- This DOES back up and restore Cydia repos, but doesn’t add the sources to the Cydia 1.1.10 or above. Which means it does download everything from those repos but not listed in the Cydia.

# About the "Restore Library" feature
So, let’s talk about the library restore feature. I listed all the items in library to test out if any files break the whole system. I found out that there were some files that killed the whole system because it’s either the version is not compatible with the files or the device itself is not optimized for that file. I will also test backward compatibility down to iOS 5.
+ iOS 9 is out, restoring SMS is the only feature that will work in "Restore Library" feature.
